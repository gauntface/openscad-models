Just a dumping ground of open scad models I put together

## Saving Exports

With a projection export, openscad (by default) fails to include any kind of size information in the SVG. To fix this, open the SVG file in a text editorr afte export and set `width="123"` to `width="123mm"` and **do the same for height**.
